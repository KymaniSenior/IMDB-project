# IMDB-project
Hello, my name is Kymani Senior. I completed this project with the following goals in mind...

The Goal of this project is to use a real-world relational database with a comprehensive dataset comprimised of a significant number of tables and to combine my understanding of how to acquire data through SQL with my knowledge of Pandas and Tableau. Using this to analyze and explore the data. 

The .ipynb is the the jupiter notebook file this project was completed in. Displaying the procceses of how SQL techniques were used to create panda dataframes. It also contains the analysis of the findings from these queires. The .twb is a Tableau file demonstrating the reults, allowing you to see visuals of the data being anylyzed.
